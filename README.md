# Data Cleaning and Wrangling

This repo contains all projects related to cleaning and wrangling data sets found in the wild.

## Halloween Candy

The first data cleaning project in this repo is [Halloween Candy](/halloween_candy). I was introduced to this data as part of the dirty data cleaning project for CodeClan. I have taken this further and performed an initial exploratory data analysis.

This folder contains:
* Two R scripts to read in and clean the data in the data_cleaning_scripts folder
* The cleaned .csv file in the clean_data folder
* The analysis R markdown script in the analysis folder


## Goodreads

The next data cleaning project is [Goodreads books](/goodreads_books). This data cleaning work was the first weekend homework I did for CodeClan. It was particularly tricky as some extra characters had crept into the csv file. The original data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks).
