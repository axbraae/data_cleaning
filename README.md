# Data Cleaning

This repo contains all projects related to cleaning data sets found in the wild.

## Halloween Candy

The first data cleaning project is [Halloween Candy](/halloween_candy). I was introduced to this data as part of the dirty data cleaning project for CodeClan.

This folder contains:
* Two R scripts to read in and clean the data in the data_cleaning_scripts folder
* The cleaned .csv file in the clean_data folder
* The analysis R markdown script in the analysis folder
