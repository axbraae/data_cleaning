This is the very first homework assignment from my CodeClan course. Included here as I love books! Also because the clean up was more tricky than originally intended.

# Data cleaning

* Initially reading in the data generated a parsing error due to mislabeled quotes
      * This was fixed by including `quote = ""` in the `read_csv()``
* 12 parsing errors remained in the data 
    - Investigating with `problems()` revealed four rows with data that has skipped a column because of an extra comma in the authors column 
    - These commas were manually removed
    - The `.csv` was resaved as `books_edit.csv`
* Missing pages were recoded as missing (`NA`) if page number was zero
* Average ratings were recoded as `NA` if average_rating = 0 and ratings_count > 0 
    (you can't have an average rating of nothing if you have had a rating count)
* Ratings count were recoded as `NA` if average_rating > 0 and ratings_count = 0
    (you can't have a rating count of nothing if there is an average rating score)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
books_clean <- read_csv(here("clean_data/books_clean.csv"))
```

## Looking at the authors
  
#### Questions I want to answer:

* How many different authors are there? 
* Who are the top ten most rated authors (based on rating count)?
* Who are the ten authors with the longest books?
      
```{r}
#count all the unique authors
books_clean %>%
  distinct(authors) %>% 
  count()
```
<br />
There are 6643 different authors listed. However, I note some authors may be listed more than once if they are coauthors. 

Let's look at the top ten authors based on total number of reviews.

```{r}
author_subset <- books_clean %>% 
  select(authors, title, ratings_count, num_pages)

reviewed_top_ten <- author_subset %>% 
  slice_max(ratings_count, n = 10)
reviewed_top_ten
```
<br />

Looks like Stephenie Meyer with the first Twilight book has received the most ratings on Goodreads! J.K. Rowling also features several times in the top ten most rated authors.

Now I will have a look at the authors with the longest books.

```{r}
longest_top_ten <- author_subset %>% 
  slice_max(num_pages, n = 10)
longest_top_ten
```

<br />

Ah, this was a bit of a trick question as the books listed with the highest page numbers are mostly box sets! Interestingly, two J.K. Rowling box sets feature in this list.

<br />

## Looking at the languages

I would like to have a look at the different languages of books in this dataset.

#### Questions I want to answer:

* How many languages are there?
* How many text reviews do books written in English have?
* How many text reviews do books written in non-English have?
* Is this count similar for the overall ratings received for English and non-English books? 
* Who are the top ten publishers of English books?
* Who are the top ten publishers of non-English books?
  
```{r}
#counting how many languages there are and arranging them alphabetically
books_clean %>% 
  distinct(language_code) %>%
  arrange(language_code)
```

<br />

There are 27 different languages in the books dataset. It looks like English is coded four times: eng (which is not a localisation language code), en-US, en-GB and en-CA. (Additional note: enm is middle english, so I will not include this as an English book).

Let's find out what the total text_reviews_count and ratings_count is in all four English groups compared to all other languages.

```{r}
#subset the dataset to answer the questions on English books
#add a column, english, set to TRUE if the language is English

language_subset <- books_clean %>% 
  select(language_code, publisher, ratings_count, text_reviews_count) %>% 
  mutate(english = case_when(
      language_code %in% c("eng", "en-GB", "en-CA", "en-US") ~ TRUE,
      TRUE ~ FALSE)
        )

#generate a summary table counting the total number of text reviews and ratings counts for English and non-English books

language_subset %>% 
  group_by(english) %>% 
  summarise(
    sum(text_reviews_count),
    sum(ratings_count, na.rm = TRUE))
```

<br />

Unsurprisingly perhaps, there are far more text reviews for books written in English (eng, en-GB, en-US and en-CA) than in all other languages combined (5997392 compared to 31823). If we put it as a percentage, 99.47% of the text reviews in this Goodreads dataset are written for English books, and only 0.53% of the text reviews are in another language.

This is also seen when looking at the total for all ratings count (198017611 ratings for English books compared to 1560813, or 78.2% of ratings compared to 21.8%).

Let's look at the publishers with the most English titles and the publishers with the most non-English titles.

```{r}
publisher_subset <- language_subset %>% 
  group_by(publisher) %>% 
  mutate(non_english = !english) %>% 
  summarise(
    tot_eng = sum(english), 
    tot_non_eng = sum(non_english)
  )
publisher_subset

#select publishers with the most books in English
top_eng_publishers <- publisher_subset %>% 
  slice_max(tot_eng, n = 10)
top_eng_publishers

#Select publishers with the most books in non-English
top_non_eng_publishers <- publisher_subset %>% 
  slice_max(tot_non_eng, n = 10)
top_non_eng_publishers
```

<br />

The top ten publishers with the most English titles are very different from the top ten publishers with the most non-English titles! Interestingly in both groups there are some book titles in other languages. The top ten publishers with non-English titles contains 11 publishers. This is because there are several publishers with the same total count of non-English books.
